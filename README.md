# Details

This app is a personal movie database created for users to keep track of movies they want to watch or have watched. 
It has two views: 
* A table view where the user can have full control of the data in the datasource
* A list view where the user can see the movies, search based on genres or keywords and update the status of the movie - set as watched or add to watchlist

The user can bulk upload movies using a CSV, which facilitates keeping the database updated
